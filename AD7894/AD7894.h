	# AD7894
	Arduino library for an Analog Devices ADC AD7894 - 10, 14 bit ADC with Â±10V range.
	Do not forget about the reference voltage source (+2.5V). Voltage divider, connected to internal Arduino source provides too much noise.

	This version operates with all 4 data pins at the ADC (3-wire serial + BUSY) without interrupts. If you want to use interrupts (BUSY pin could provide interrupt at the falling edge), than use functions from the private field: BeginConversion() and ADCread();

	Class constructor requires number of pins ADC connected to:
	SCLK, SDATA, BUSY, CONVST. The default values are 5,2,3,4. If you connected your ADC to those pins, you can use just <AD7894 myADC>;

	Only 3 functions are available:
	Begin(); - checks PIN's numbers and set them to I/O modes.
	GetVoltage(); - return float value of voltage at the ADC input in Volts. 
	GetError(); - return the error value. 0 is OK, 1 - timeout, 2 - wrong pins set.


	Created by Risele for everyone's use (profit and non-profit).

	ALL THESE WOR_DS
	ARE YOURS EXCEPT
	RISELE
	ATTEMPT NO
	namechangING THERE
	USE THEM TOGETHER
	USE THEM IN PEACE
